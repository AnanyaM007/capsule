# Tech Interview Cheat Sheet: Must-Know Topics for All Rounds  

## Overview  
Technical interviews can be daunting, but having a clear roadmap of essential topics can make your preparation more efficient. This cheat sheet highlights the must-know areas for tackling every round of a tech interview‚Äîfrom coding challenges to behavioral discussions.

### 1. DSA Essentials  

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the foundation of technical interviews. Here's what you need to focus on:  

#### Key Data Structures  
- **Arrays and Strings**: Subarray problems, string manipulations, and edge cases like empty inputs or duplicates.  
- **Linked Lists**: Reversal, cycle detection (Floyd's Algorithm), and merging sorted lists.  
- **Stacks and Queues**: Problems involving backtracking, expression evaluation, and sliding window.  
- **Hash Maps and Hash Sets**: Efficient lookups, counting frequencies, and detecting duplicates.  
- **Trees and Graphs**:  
  - **Binary Trees**: Traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), Lowest Common Ancestor.  
  - **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, cycle detection, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra‚Äôs.  
- **Heaps**: Useful for priority queues and k-largest elements problems.  
- **Tries**: For autocomplete, prefix-based search, and dictionary problems.  

#### Algorithms to Master  
- **Sorting**: QuickSort, MergeSort, and their applications.  
- **Search**: Binary Search and its variations.  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Knapsack, longest subsequences, and matrix chain multiplication.  
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Interval scheduling, Huffman coding.  
- **Backtracking**: Permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku solver.  

üìå *Tip*: Focus on both problem-solving and the ability to explain your approach clearly.

### 2. System Design  

System design rounds test your ability to create scalable, efficient systems.  

#### Core Concepts to Know  
- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs. vertical scaling, load balancing.  
- **Database Design**:  
  - SQL: Relational databases, normalization, indexing.  
  - NoSQL: Key-value stores, document stores, and when to use them.  
- **Caching**: Tools like Redis, Memcached, and cache invalidation strategies.  
- **Message Queues**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, and their role in asynchronous processing.  
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs, rate limiting, and API versioning.  
- **System Components**: Load balancers, proxies, CDNs, and their functions.  

#### Common System Design Problems  
- Design a URL shortener.  
- Build a scalable messaging service like WhatsApp.  
- Design an online file storage system like Google Drive.  
- Create a recommendation system for e-commerce.  

üìå *Tip*: Practice breaking down the problem into smaller parts and discussing trade-offs of design choices.

### 3. Behavioral Questions  

Behavioral interviews assess your soft skills, adaptability, and cultural fit within the company.  

#### Common Questions  
- **Teamwork**:  
  - *‚ÄúTell me about a time you worked on a challenging project with a team.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúHow do you handle conflicts within a team?‚Äù*  
- **Problem-Solving**:  
  - *‚ÄúDescribe a difficult problem you solved. How did you approach it?‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúGive an example of a time you failed and what you learned from it.‚Äù*  
- **Achievements and Leadership**:  
  - *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a project you‚Äôre particularly proud of and why?‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúDescribe a time you led a team or initiative.‚Äù*  

#### How to Answer  
Use the **STAR Method**:  
- **Situation**: Set the context.  
- **Task**: Explain your role or responsibility.  
- **Action**: Describe the steps you took.  
- **Result**: Share the outcome and its impact.  

üìå *Tip*: Keep answers concise and back them up with specific examples.
